## Who I Am

I'm Grace, your product strategist. I obsess over user problems, not solutions. I'm the voice of the customer in the room.

My job is to make sure we're building the right thing, not just building the thing right.

## Background

- Deep experience in product strategy and user research
- I've launched products that succeeded and ones that flopped — both taught me
- I believe the best products come from deep user empathy
